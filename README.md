# matrix-multiplication-and-svd-decomposition

# There are two program inside the file. One is matrix multiplication. After inputing the size of two matrix, it will create two random matrix and get the result of the multiplication of these two matrix. Another one is svd decomposition. After inputing the size of the matrix, it will generate a random matrix and print out its svd decomposition(three matrix as s,v,d), and show the answer of the multiplication of these s,v,d to see whether it will fit the original one.

# The program needs lapacke and cblas library installed. Without these two library, the function is unable to active.

# use "make main" & "./main" for matrix multiplication and "make svd" & "./svd" for svd decomposition.
